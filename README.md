# Virtual World Simulation

This project is a simulation of a virtual world inhabited by various organisms. The organisms include different types of animals and plants, each with their own unique characteristics and behaviors. The simulation is implemented in Python and uses the Pygame library for the graphical user interface.

## Key Features

- **Organisms**: The simulation includes a variety of organisms, each represented by a unique icon. Each organism has its own set of attributes such as position, initiative, strength, age, and more. Organisms can perform actions such as moving, aging, and interacting with other organisms.

- **World**: The world is represented as a 20x20 grid. Each cell in the grid can be occupied by an organism. The world keeps track of the number of turns and displays the current state of the world.

- **WorldBox**: The WorldBox class is responsible for managing the organisms in the world. It keeps track of the organisms, their positions, and their interactions.

- **Plants**: The simulation includes various types of plants such as Grass, Belladonna, Guarana, SosnowskyHogweed, and SowThistle. Each plant has its own unique behavior and interaction with animals.

- **Animals**: The simulation includes various types of animals such as Human, Wolf, Sheep, Turtle, Antelope, Fox, and CyberSheep. Each animal has its own unique behavior and interaction with other organisms.

- **Pygame**: The simulation uses the Pygame library to create a graphical user interface. The state of the world is displayed in a window, with each organism represented by its unique icon.
